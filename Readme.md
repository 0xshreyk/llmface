# Deploy your Large language Models without worrying about interface.

## Introduction
### What is LLM?
An LLM, or large language model, is essentially a computer program that's been trained on a massive amount of text data. This data can come from all sorts of sources, like books, articles, websites, and even code. By analyzing all this information, LLMs become really good at understanding and responding to human language. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)

### What's the problem?

**Well**, we've seen a sudden surge of people **deploying LLMs**. While the training is mostly go through by an experienced team. **Stunts** are performed at **Deployment**.
At the very recent level is an example, **Gemini**.

These potential misconfigurations are natural while traning such a big model. But it is to be prevented from any potential exploit.
### What this do?

The purpose of this software is simple, **platformability**. A stage of art for presenting your creation with the least of effort going into it, _literally_.

#### It do it for you.
* Fast deployment
* Maintenance through UI.
* Exploit protection
* Enhanced security
* Hook up experience
* Fast paced growth
* Almost _instant_ Emergency shutdowns
